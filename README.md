## Overview

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated and prolonged cyber-attacks typically orchestrated by nation-states or organized groups. This research focuses on:

- Gathering Information: Researching specific APT groups. 
- Payload Collection: Acquiring samples of their malicious payloads. 
- TTP Documentation: Recording their tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
- Feature Extraction: Identifying features suitable for AI-based methods. 
- AI Agent Development: Building AI models to detect APTs’ malicious payloads. 

The research assignment is from the course CIS*6530 (W 25) – Cyber Threat Intelligence and Adversarial Risk Analysis by professor [Dr. Ali Dehghantanha](https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/people/ali-dehghantanha) and with the teaching assistant [Keerthana Madanu](kmadanu@uoguelph.ca) at [University of Guelph](http://uoguelph.ca)
